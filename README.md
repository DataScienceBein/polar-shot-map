### Generated Image

## Get Started

Simply run `main.py` and it will save a image in `.images\`

## Note

1. If you're using system Python, the plot generated by matplotlib might not be perfectly aligned (different components out of place). However, the saved output image should be fine. 

2. If you're gonna use this code, **please please** try to change things on your own. I've talked to [Peter McKeever](https://twitter.com/petermckeever) and he strongly suggested to me and hence I'd strongly suggest to you to change things up - use the code as a starting point and not the end result. Try newer colors, change axis labels, different font colors, styles, themes whatever.


---------
The code is probably not the cleanest so any contribution in that direction is most welcome.
