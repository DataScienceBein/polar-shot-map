## Get Started

Simply run `main.py` and it will save a image in `.images\`

**Note**: If you're using system Python, the plot generated by matplotlib might not be perfectly aligned (different components out of place). However, the saved output image should be fine.

The code is probably not the cleanest so any contribution in that direction is most welcome.
